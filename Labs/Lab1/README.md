In the development of this project, I have utilized various resources and adapted certain elements based on external code and assets. Below are the details of these implementations:

Profile Picture:
-Where Implemented: The profile picture is used on the biography page of the website.
-How Implemented: The image was retrieved from Pixabay and implemented as an img element within the HTML structure.
-Why Implemented: This image was chosen because it embodies the concept of an anonymous profile picture, fitting well with the biography template where user details are yet to be filled.
-How Modified: The image was resized and cropped to fit the layout of the biography section.

Google Fonts API:
-Where Implemented: Google Fonts API is used across the entire website to apply the chosen fonts.
-How Implemented: The fonts are included through <link> tags in the HTML head section, referencing the Google Fonts API.
-Why Implemented: The specific fonts were chosen for their visual appeal and the way they complement the website's design theme.
-How Modified: CSS was used to specify font-families for different elements

Placeholder Text (Lorem Ipsum):
-Where Implemented: Placeholder text is used throughout the template sections where actual content will eventually be placed.
-How Implemented: Generated Lorem Ipsum text from lipsum.com was inserted into paragraphs within the HTML content.
-Why Implemented: The use of placeholder text allows for a better visual representation of content layout, facilitating design decisions regarding typography, spacing, and overall page balance.
-How Modified: The text was broken into paragraphs and sections to fit the content areas of the website.
